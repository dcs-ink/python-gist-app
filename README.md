# Simple Python Script For Creating Gists

This is a simple script I'm working on. Current functionality pops up a GUI where you can name the file and add your content. Upon clicking 'Create Gist' it is uploaded to your github gists.

Future functionality
- List previous "x" gists created
- Option to stay on top of other windows
- styling - make it look more modern

It uses Github's gists API https://api.github.com/gists 

You'll need a token and to store that token in a file called ".github_token" located in the same directory as your script.
